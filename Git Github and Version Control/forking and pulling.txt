Fork and Pull Workflow

The fork and pull workflow is a common way of contributing to open-source projects on platforms like GitHub. It allows developers to make changes to a project without needing direct write access to the main repository. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Fork the Repository**: 
    - Go to the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.
    - Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**:
    - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
      ```
    - Navigate into the cloned repository:
      ```
      cd repository-name
      ```

3. **Create a New Branch**:
    - Create a new branch to work on your changes:
      ```
      git checkout -b feature-branch-name
      ```

4. **Make Changes and Commit**:
    - Make the necessary changes to the codebase.
    - Stage the changes:
      ```
      git add .
      ```
    - Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
      ```
      git commit -m "Description of the changes"
      ```

5. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
    - Push your changes to your forked repository:
      ```
      git push origin feature-branch-name
      ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
    - Go to the original repository on GitHub.
    - Click the "New Pull Request" button.
    - Select the branch you just pushed to your forked repository and compare it with the base branch of the original repository.
    - Provide a title and description for your pull request, then click "Create Pull Request".

7. **Review and Merge**:
    - The repository maintainers will review your pull request.
    - They may request changes or approve and merge your pull request into the main repository.

By following this workflow, you can contribute to projects without needing direct write access, and maintainers can review and manage contributions effectively.
