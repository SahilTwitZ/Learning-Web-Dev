Branching and merging are essential concepts for collaboration on GitHub.

**Branching:**
- A branch in Git is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit.
- The default branch name in Git is `main` (previously `master`).
- Branches allow you to work on different features or bug fixes independently of the main codebase.
- To create a new branch, use the command:
    ```
    git branch <branch-name>
    ```
- Switch to the new branch using:
    ```
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```
    or
    ```
    git switch <branch-name>
    ```

**Merging:**
- Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another.
- To merge a branch into the current branch, use:
    ```
    git merge <branch-name>
    ```
- If there are conflicts (i.e., changes that contradict each other), Git will prompt you to resolve them manually.

**Workflow:**
1. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
     ```
     git checkout -b <feature-branch>
     ```
2. Make your changes and commit them:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of changes"
     ```
3. Push the branch to GitHub:
     ```
     git push origin <feature-branch>
     ```
4. Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub to merge your changes into the `main` branch.
5. After review, merge the PR on GitHub, or locally using:
     ```
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     git merge <feature-branch>
     ```

By using branches, multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Merging allows you to integrate these changes back into the main codebase.
